\title{Chatterjee Multiple Linear Regression}
\usage{
cmlr(x, plot.out = FALSE, trace = 2, dir = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data frame for regression, where the first column is the dependent variable.}

\item{plot.out}{a boolen value indicating whether to provide diagnostic plots.}

\item{trace}{a nonnegative integer [0, 2], indicating how much diagnostic and processing
information to print as the function runs. Specifically, 0 will print no information,
1 will print the initial and final models, and 2 will print everything.}

\item{dir}{the direction in which you want to do stepwise model selection.}
